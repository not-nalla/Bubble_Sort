Bubble Sort Program in C (Numbers and Strings)

This C program demonstrates the Bubble Sort algorithm for sorting both integers and strings. It takes user input, displays the elements before sorting, applies bubble sort logic, and then prints the sorted output.

--Features
~Sorts an array of numbers in ascending order
~Sorts an array of strings in alphabetical order
~Uses basic C concepts like arrays, loops, and functions from string.h
~Shows the state of data before and after sorting

Purpose
This program is designed for learning and understanding the Bubble Sort algorithm and how it can be applied to different data types in C.
